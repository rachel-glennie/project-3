<div class="info">
	<h2>Who We Are</h2>
	<p>At CC’s, we serve coffee up hot with a side of strange. Our start was simple - we took a bunch of weird stuff and added our loves of coffee and baking. That’s how we got started, and how we’ve kept it.</p>
</div>

<div class="food">
	<h2>Our Treats</h2>
	<p>Each day’s edibles vary with the seasons and whatever we feel like making. Anything can be available from tarts to donuts to nanaimo bars to fresh bread. We occasionally showcase goods from local bakers. Here’s some of our recent creations.</p>
